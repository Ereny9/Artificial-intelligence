Artificial Intelligence Tools & Frameworks
Development of neural networks is a long process which requires a lot of thought behind the architecture and a whole bunch of nuances which actually make up the system.

AI - Artificial Intelligence Tools & Frameworks- edureka

These nuances can easily end up getting overwhelming and not everything can be easily tracked. Hence, the need for such tools arises, where humans handle the major architectural decisions leaving other optimization tasks to such tools. Imagine an architecture with just 4 possible boolean hyperparameters, testing all possible combinations would take 4! Runs. Retraining the same architecture 24 times is definitely not the best use of time and energy.

Also, most of the newer algorithms contain a whole bunch of hyperparameters. Hereâ€™s where new tools come into the picture. These tools not only help develop but also, optimize these networks.

List of  AI Tools & Frameworks
From the dawn of mankind, we as a species have always been trying to make things to assist us in day to day tasks. From stone tools to modern day machinery, to tools for making the development of programs to assist us in day to day life. Some of the most important tools and frameworks are:
<ul>
<li>Scikit Learn</li>
<li>TensorFlow</li>
<li>Theano</li>
<li>Caffe</li>
